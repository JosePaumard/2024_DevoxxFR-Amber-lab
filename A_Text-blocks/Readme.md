## Text Blocks

This first part is about Text blocks, a new way to write strings of characters, added the JDK 15.

### Simple Text Blocks

This set of exercises shows you how you can use a text block for a multilines string of characters, instead of having a concatenation of several strings, each one line. By completing these exercises, you will learn:
- how to create a text block, and correctly place the opening and closing triple double quotes,
- analyze the string written in the text block, and make sure it is a multiline string,
- control the position of the limit between the incidental white spaces and the text block itself,
- control the line feed at the end of each line, removing it completely, or making sure that the trailing blank spaces are kept.
